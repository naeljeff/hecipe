Example of commit message:

## Git Workflow

This repository has one main branch: **main**. If you are developing new feature or fixing bug, you must create new branch and checkout to that new branch.

```
git checkout main
git checkout -b "your-branch-name"
```

Branch name is same with the **commit message** name. Just make the name short simple and brief.

After you finish create your feature, you may create merge request.
